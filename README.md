This is an Excel spreadsheet I created to simplify VM capacity calculations and planning at my day job, without requiring expensive commercial products or tools only available to partners. This was developed during a new cluster design project, after about the 4th time I had to re-run my capacity numbers based on different scenarios.

The intent is to assist with analyzing your current capacity and provisioning levels, as well as assist with specifying new hardware to meet a given capacity need. It also makes it easy to model different scenarios by turning on and off various new workloads/projects to see how different combinations will affect the numbers.
